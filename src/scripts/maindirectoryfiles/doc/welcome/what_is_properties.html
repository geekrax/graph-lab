<p class="doctitle">Properties Sidebar</p>

<p>The<span class="keyword"> Properties sidebar</span> will help you to change 
the properties of your currently selected graph, vertices and edges. Some of 
them are editable, and some of them not. For example directed (in graph 
properties) can not be changed, the graph direction is determined at&nbsp; creation time and can not be 
changed after that.</p>
<p>In the normal mode when nothing is selected, the properties sidebar will show 
graph properties:</p>

<p  class="image"><img border="0" src="properties_graph.PNG" width="512" height="304"><br>
Graph Properties</p>

<p ><span class="keyword">Show Vertex Labels</span> and <span class="keyword">Show Edge Labels</span> 
will only change the graph view, hiding labels will help you to see the whole 
structure of graph. If you are editing a large graph, hiding labels will help 
Graph<sup>Lab</sup> to draw the graph faster.</p>
<p ><span class="keyword">Is Edges Curved</span> attribute determines whether the graph edges are curved or not. By setting this to yes you can draw curved edges in you graph.</p>
<p >When a single vertex or a single edge is selected their 
properties will be shown:</p>

<p class="image"><img border="0" src="properties_vertex.PNG" width="556" height="294"><br>Vertex Properties</p>

<p class="image"><img border="0" src="properties_edge.PNG" width="530" height="256"><br>Edge Properties</p>

<p >Note that the <span class="keyword">color</span> property is both an integer and a 
color. when the algorithms set the color, they set it to a number like 3, then
Graph<sup>Lab</sup> uses a map and shows it as a green. you can set the 
colors as any color you like, for this choose <span class="keyword">Color Editor</span> from the 
drop down menu that appears when clicking on the Color properties.</p>
<p ><span class="keyword">Label Location</span> attribute will help you to change the relative location of edges/vertices labels.</p>
<p >The default edge label is its weight, by changing the <span class="keyword">Show 
Weight</span> property of edge, The shown label will be its <span class="keyword">Label</span> 
property.</p>
<p >When you selected multiple edges and vertices, The property editor will show 
all available properties for them, the values shown in front of each property 
are not necessarily the properties of all selected vertices/edges, but by 
changing them you can apply the new property to all of them.</p>
<p class="image"><img  border="0" src="properties_selected.PNG" width="539" height="378"><br>Selection Properties</p>

<p>The <span class="keyword">Vertices</span> and <span class="keyword">Edges</span> properties shows you the number of selected vertices/edges.</p>
