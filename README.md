Edge Coloring Of Graph:
=======================
Our project started with studying Vizing’s theorem and its proof.
Vizing’s theorem gave rise to NP-Complete Classification problem. We gave NP-Completeness reduction from 3-SAT to Chromatic number(Classification problem). We then gave state of are of edge coloring problem. Finally it is followed by applications of edge coloring and Its Approximation Algorithm implementation.
